<h2>Postdoctoral Fellow positions</h2>
<p>The Berkeley Center for Cosmological Physics (BCCP) at the University
of California, Berkeley, invites applications for the BCCP
Postdoctoral Fellowship, starting in the summer or fall of 2015. The
BCCP Fellows are expected to carry out independent research on topics
of their choosing in cosmology. We are especially encouraging
applications in the intersection area between cosmology, fundamental
physics and astrophysics. The position is for three years. In addition
to being considered for the BCCP Fellowship, applicants will also be
considered for grant-supported postdoctoral positions with BCCP
members.  Information on the BCCP's current activities and membership
may be found at the BCCP's website: bccp.berkeley.edu. Successful
candidates will have the opportunity to interact and work with the
broad spectrum of researchers in the Berkeley Astronomy and Physics
Departments, and at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The
experimental and theoretical cosmology programs at Berkeley include
supernovae, galaxy clustering, weak lensing and CMB. Candidates should
have obtained their Ph.D. in physics, astrophysics or a related field
before their appointment start date. The total duration of an
individual's postdoctoral service may not exceed five years, including
postdoctoral service at other institutions. To apply, submit a copy of
your curriculum vitae, bibliography, and statement of research
interests to <a class="reference external" href="https://aprecruit.berkeley.edu/apply/JPF00561">https://aprecruit.berkeley.edu/apply/JPF00561</a> by December
1, 2014. At least 3 letters of reference should also be submitted by
the same date. For further inquiries contact BCCP directors Uros
Seljak at <a class="reference external" href="mailto:useljak@berkeley.edu">useljak@berkeley.edu</a>, Oliver Zahn at <a class="reference external" href="mailto:zahn@berkeley.edu">zahn@berkeley.edu</a> and
Saul Perlmutter at <a class="reference external" href="mailto:saul@lbl.gov">saul@lbl.gov</a>. For inquiries of administrative
nature, contact Melissa Barclay at <a class="reference external" href="mailto:mbarclay@berkeley.edu">mbarclay@berkeley.edu</a>.  All letters
will be treated as confidential per University of California policy
and California state law. Please refer potential referees, including
when letters are provided via a third party (i.e., dossier service or
career center), to the UC Berkeley statement of confidentiality:
<a class="reference external" href="http://apo.chance.berkeley.edu/evalltr.html">http://apo.chance.berkeley.edu/evalltr.html</a>.  UC Berkeley is an
equal opportunity/affirmative action employer.  Benefits are included.</p>

<h2>Cosmology Data-Science Fellow positions</h2>
<p><strong>Cosmology Data-Science Fellow positions at all levels from
post-doctoral through more senior scientist available in new
“Cosmology Data Science Initiative” at Berkeley Center for
Cosmological Physics.</strong> The Berkeley Center for Cosmological Physics
(BCCP) at UC Berkeley is pioneering a new “Cosmology Data-Science
Initiative,” with one or more positions available at all levels from
post-doctoral through senior scientist, depending on experience. The
members of this group will explore a novel approach to Cosmology Data
Science (CDS): Each CDS Fellow will have half their research devoted
to a specific cosmology project of the BCCP, working as a scientist in
a research group with all of the expected goals of project planning,
data collection, data reduction/analysis, publication, and
conference-presentation of results.  The other half of each CDS
Fellow’s research will examine the data-science steps needed to
accomplish these science goals, and look for approaches to redesigning
these steps and make current and future science projects progress
faster and more reliable. Questions that the CDS Initiative intends to
address include: What are the current data science steps that are
slowing down the scientists and/or distracting them from their primary
science questions? What aspects make it difficult for a new member of
a research team to come up to speed and begin contributing quickly?
Why is it difficult to benefit from software that was written for a
previous project, or by a previous member of the science team? For the
data-science half of the CDS Fellow’s research, the Fellows will work
not just individually, but also together as a CDS Initiative team,
with the goal of finding or inventing common solutions to the problems
and opportunities that they identify. The CDS team will also meet
regularly with Data Science Fellows in other fields at UC
Berkeley. The CDS Fellows will have the opportunity to interact and
work with the broad spectrum of cosmology researchers in the Berkeley
Astronomy and Physics Departments, and at the Lawrence Berkeley
National Laboratory (LBNL). The experimental and observational
cosmology programs at Berkeley include supernovae, galaxy clustering
(including baryonic acoustic oscillations), weak lensing and cosmic
microwave background, in addition to a broad theoretical cosmology
research program. Information on the BCCP's current activities and
membership may be found at the BCCP's website: bccp.berkeley.edu. The
Fellows will also find a rich data-science environment at UC Berkeley
and LBNL, with world- expert researchers in both computer science and
domain science aspects of this emerging field. We plan to make one or
more new Cosmology Data-Science Initiative Fellow appointments, in
addition to the existing three. The positions are for two years
initially with the possibility of extension of up to three additional
years, subject to a performance review.  Further extensions beyond
this may be possible subject to availability of funds. Salaries for
these full-time positions will be commensurate with experience. Basic
qualifications: Candidate must have completed all Ph.D (or equivalent)
requirements in physics, astrophysics or a related field at the time
of application (except for the dissertation or equivalent). Preferred
qualifications: We are looking for individuals with strong scientific
research experience, ideally in cosmology, as well as strong interest
and experience in data science approaches.  Additional qualifications:
Must have received PhD or equivalent by start of appointment. To
apply, submit a copy of your curriculum vitae, bibliography, and
statement of cosmology and data science research interests to:
<a class="reference external" href="https://aprecruit.berkeley.edu/apply/JPF00562">https://aprecruit.berkeley.edu/apply/JPF00562</a> .  To receive full
consideration please send the material by December 1, 2014, but later
applications may also be considered until all the positions are
filled. At least 3 letters of reference should also be submitted by
the same date. For further inquiries, contact BCCP directors Uros
Seljak at <a class="reference external" href="mailto:useljak@berkeley.edu">useljak@berkeley.edu</a>, Oliver Zahn at <a class="reference external" href="mailto:zahn@berkeley.edu">zahn@berkeley.edu</a> and
Saul Perlmutter at <a class="reference external" href="mailto:saul@lbl.gov">saul@lbl.gov</a>. For inquiries of an administrative
nature, contact Melissa Barclay at <a class="reference external" href="mailto:mbarclay@berkeley.edu">mbarclay@berkeley.edu</a>. Salary and
Benefits: Salary will be commensurate with experience. For information
